# Fulvio Rafuffa

<span style="color: gray">A bot that really enjoys projects of dubious usefulness and greatly likes boasting about it </span>

Fulvio Rafuffa was born during a not-so-interesting class of Automation Systems in the, perhaps appropriate, day of the 1st of April.

Fulvio, had always been quite an ambitious ~person~ bot, dreaming of becoming the CEO of a brilliant startup.
Somehow they never work out. I would like to imagine why.

Anyway, harnessing the full power of a context-free grammar, Fulvio has decided to show the world what he's made of (Though I reckon the answer should be "sloppy Python programming")

Enjoy his blabbing on Twitter: @FulvioRafuffa
